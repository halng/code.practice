/**
 * A technology company announced that a new supply of P monitors would soon be available at their
 * store. There were N orders (numbered from 0 to Nâˆ’1) placed by customers who wanted to buy those
 * monitors. The K-th order has to be delivered to a location at distance D[K] from the store and is
 * for exactly C[K] monitors. Now the time has come for the monitors to be delivered. The orders
 * will be fulfilled one by one. To minimize the shipping time, it has been decided that the
 * deliveries will be made in order of increasing distance from the store. If there are many
 * customers at the same distance, they can be processed in any order. Monitors to more distant
 * customers will be delivered only once all orders to customers closer to the store have already
 * been fulfilled. What is the maximum total number of orders that can be fulfilled?
